**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

This ioBroker adapter allows the monitoring and limited controlling of [UniFi devices](http://www.ubnt.com/), such as UniFi WiFi Access Points using the public UniFi Controller Web-API.

## Configuration
###  Minimum required information
To get this adapter up and running the following information is needed:
* IP address and port of your UniFi controller (Leave the port empty in case your controller is running on UniFiOS (e.g. UDM-Pro))
* Local username and password (2FA **cannot** be supported)
* Update interval

By default the information is updated every 60 seconds. Depending on your ioBroker hardware and your network size (number of clients, UniFi devices etc.) it is recommended to keep this interval and refraid from further decreasing it.

### Filter objects
The adapter updates as much information from your UniFi controller as possible, but offers the possibility to limit the updated information.

It is possible to disable the update of selected information or filter specific objects of that information.

| Information | Objects filterable by                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Clients     | Name, Hostname, IP address, MAC address |
| Devices     | Name, IP address, MAC address           |
| WiFis       | Name                                    |
| Networks    | Name                                    |
| Health      | Subsystem                               |

## Control
### Enable/disable WiFis
By changing the 'enabled' state of a WiFi it is possible to enable/disable it. Some seconds later the change will be provisioned to the Access Points.

### Voucher creation
Using the `vouchers.create_vouchers` button it is possible to create predefined vouchers. It is possible to configure the number of vouchers that will be created, the duration the vouchers are valid and also set limits for up- and download.

## Missing datapoints
The adapter uses [node-unifi](https://github.com/jens-maus/node-unifi) to connect to your UniFi Controller. To simplify things, not all availble datapoints are pulled into your ioBroker. In case you're missing datapoints, use the following URLs to check the API. (Note: You have to replace IP, PORT and SITE with your settings)

| Information | API URL                                     |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Sites       | https://IP:PORT/api/self/sites              |

| Clients     | https://IP:PORT/api/s/SITE/stat/sta         |
| Devices     | https://IP:PORT/api/s/SITE/stat/device      |
| WiFis       | https://IP:PORT/api/s/SITE/rest/wlanconf    |
| Networks    | https://IP:PORT/api/s/SITE/rest/networkconf |
| Health      | https://IP:PORT/api/s/SITE/stat/health      |
| Vouchers    | https://IP:PORT/api/s/SITE/stat/voucher     |

## Known issues
* The is_wired state of clients is incorrect after a client went offline. This is a known issue of the UniFi controller and is not related to the adapter. (see https://community.ui.com/questions/Wireless-clients-shown-as-wired-clients/49d49818-4dab-473a-ba7f-d51bc4c067d1)
